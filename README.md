# alx_html_css
# CSS Advanced Project

This project focuses on implementing advanced CSS styling for a Final Design from Figma. You’ll use semantic HTML from the "HTML, advanced" project and replicate the following design sections:

- Header & Banner  
- Quotes Section  
- Videos List Section  
- Membership Section  
- FAQ Section  
- Footer

---

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Add semantic HTML structure and link your Figma assets (images/fonts).
2. Create `styles.css` and import it into `index.html`.
3. Accurately replicate the Figma design for each section.
4. Keep CSS simple—use clear selectors and avoid over-nesting.
5. Centralize repeated styles (typography, colors).
6. Ensure final result visually matches the Figma design.
7. Follow responsive best practices and include accessible markup.
